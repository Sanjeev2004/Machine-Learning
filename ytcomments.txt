people are getting the chance to learn deep learning with so much details just because of your efforts. thanks a lot
best video
sir we need only one epoch to get max acuracay , our trainable parameters is just trained by your examples
very very thank you sir.
thanks!
thank you so much sir... you spent the whole night for this video and made this video too easy for us... keep it up sir.. and thanks a lottttttttt .... we student are thankful to have such kind of teacher in out hardworking journey....
sir here what is meant by a2 matrix,is it means a group of training is going on or what?
sir, you are a legend. i can never imagine that i can get this much of valuable content for free on internet.
nitish sir&#39;s teaching = low bias and low variance, maximum accuracy in 1 epoch.. 💯💯
trust me , teaching style is super super awesome .thank you sir
thanks❤
too much informative . thanks sir 😄.
your teaching style and knowledge is way ahead....excellent.
thanks!
sir, i have a question from this lecture at the point when you find (del a2 / del z2 ) you directly wrote the answer.... a2=sigmoid of z2 .. how does its derivative equals a2(1-a2)...kindly, just explain a bit ere ...bcz i thought sigmoid is 1/(1+e^-z2)  ... just kindly clear me here..
definitely it shows how hard work you did sir. you have no need to ask us to like and subscribe your channel. i do it every time before the start of video because i know, every video is extremely informative. begging your blessings.

goat
killer explanation👌
crack it 🎇
waah! sir kya samjaya hain! data science apse hi compele karege hum!<br>thank you!
like and comment everyone to make this channel&#39;s reach wider and broader.
u r everything for us sir
1/m se multiply kyon karna padega sir, agar 1,m ki image hai to?
sir , one doubt<br><br>in w1 when we are saying we have w1 metrics of 3 by 3  and these are the weights  ,  <br>so when we are updating the w1  values using gardient descent , so are we modifieg those fillter values only  . or that fillter values also have some diffrent w1 metrc which is actually modified . <br><br>bvz if i am doing convolution with some fillter , say an edge detectoer fillter  ,  then it is obvious that the value in that fillter should not chnge as by tht fillter i am trying to detect the edges .
caa anyone please confirm me that after applying pooling of order 2 by 2 the obtained matrix is of order 3 by 3?
gem
god gifted teacher for us ai students. one in a million. krish naik sir also teaches, but nitish sir&#39;s explanation to the minutest detail so easily that it gets imprinted in the brain forever, no requirement of revising again. the topics are covered and explained so good that even a 12th pass student can also understand. may you live longer and keep teaching us this way.

why do we multiply the formula by 1/m
thank you so much sir from bottom of heart
bro,try english,it helps many more people
amazing explanation
@campusx, should not the size of f remain (4, 1) even if we send in as mini-batch, as only 1 image will be passed in loop over the batch? have you written son, as you combined them to avoid loops?
so if cost function is quadratic loss, all of the equation will change na ?
thanks
is cnn model trained for every pridiction of image classification? like for every prdiction model needs to trained
super clear - thank u so much for such great content sir..
