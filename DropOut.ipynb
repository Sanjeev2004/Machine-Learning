    "## Dropout Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting in neural networks by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. It works by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps to break up situations where network units co-adapt too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To reduce overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "- **How it works**: Randomly drops units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Typically implemented in layers of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "- Helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- Encourages the network to learn more robust features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "In a neural network layer, dropout can be applied as follows: ```\n",
    "In this example, `Dropout(0.5)` means that 50% of the input units are dropped randomly during training.\n",
